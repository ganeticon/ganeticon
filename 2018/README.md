Workshops, sprints etc. held during the second day of the conference.

### ganeti.org content fixes

Following some findings and comments on the state of various resources for information:

www aka https://github.com/ganeti/website

* Sanitize next-level links to Documentation, Source, Downloads
* Clear out what is /rendered/ where and how
* Identify the actual up-to-date-state of the information, this leads to investigation of "ganeti/docs" and features
* Move "Development" information to i.e. to "ganeticon/ganeti" (the ganeti source repo, where the development are taking place), and remove CLA
* Fix/Remove linkage to "wiki" or keep it and bring it up-to-date, too. See "wiki"
* Issue tracker links is down. Just point the the corresponding github issue page?


wiki aka https://code.google.com/p/ganeti.wiki/
* git remote url is down, but Georg has a local copy and can push it to "ganeticon" (maybe mark it as old and/or legacy)
* Summarize the state and compare to the other sources

docs aka https://github.com/ganeti/docs

* Needs massive house keeping
* Volunteers needed to check the truth of the information and keep in sync with Apollon when and how which defaults will be changed.
* Some kind of best practices or at least various simple setups need to be handled differently
* Group content into install-, admin-, and maybe even user-guides
* The website repo includes a dump/backup of rendered content from "docs". Why? How should the old information be keeped to do not brake current documentation state?


Till we have a proper workflow, who has time to have an eye on these topics, too? Any ideas on how to coordinate work? Pair-sessions via voice/video-call?
How wants to go through i.e. the install docs and test it on Debian _AND_ Ubuntu to identify missing pieces and errors?

### vCluster Howto

TBD

### Ganeti Github repository bug closing sprint

TBD

## Code diet - how to improve the codebase

TBD

## Next year's GanetiCon

We discussed options for next year's GanetiCon - if you have other suggestions, feel free to add below:

### May 2019, Copenhagen
Petter suggested to integrate the GanetiCon with the NeIC (Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration) conference happening in May 2019 (14th - 16th of May). The conference is governmentally funded so there might be a (small) conference fee for attendants to cover the location and catering. We will update this document as soon as we know more.
The GanetiCon would run as a workshop during the conference and can extend up to two days.

## Other upcoming meetups/workshops

We might be able to meet/setup workshops during the following future events:
* Fosdem
* FrosCon
* 35C3
